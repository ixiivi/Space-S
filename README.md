CEE4408 Construction Project Management Final Project  

Project Overview

In a future where war between humans and AI has rendered coexistence on Earth impossible, this application is designed to support the relocation of high-intelligence AI robots to Mars. Following a historic agreement between humans and AI, each person is allowed to send one robot to Mars. In exchange, participants receive the right to invest in the planet’s rare minerals.  

This app streamlines the entire process, offering an intuitive and efficient platform for users. Its key features include:  
- Robot Selection and Ordering: Users can select and customize their AI robots for Mars deployment.  
- Launch Process Management: Monitor and manage the launch sequence of the robots.  
- Scheduler: Plan and track timelines for robot deployment.  
- Delivery Schedule Management: Oversee the transportation and delivery logistics to Mars.  
- Dividend Management: Manage investment returns from Mars’ rare mineral resources.  

This application provides a seamless experience, bridging the gap between Earth-based users and the complexities of interplanetary relocation and investment.
