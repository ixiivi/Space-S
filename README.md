## Project Overview  

In a future where war between humans and AI has rendered coexistence on Earth impossible, this application is designed to support the relocation of high-intelligence AI robots to Mars. Following a historic agreement between humans and AI, each person is allowed to send one robot to Mars. In exchange, participants receive the right to invest in the planetâ€™s rare minerals.  

This app streamlines the entire process, offering an intuitive and efficient platform for users. Its key features include:  
- Robot Selection and Ordering: Users can select and customize their AI robots for Mars deployment.  
- Launch Process Management: Monitor and manage the launch sequence of the robots.  
- Scheduler: Plan and track timelines for robot deployment.  
- Delivery Schedule Management: Oversee the transportation and delivery logistics to Mars.  
- Dividend Management: Manage investment returns from Marsâ€™ rare mineral resources.  

This application provides a seamless experience, bridging the gap between Earth-based users and the complexities of interplanetary relocation and investment.

The main application icon symbolizes the dynamic launch of a rocket, representing the ambition and innovation of construction project management. Set against a sleek black background, it features a white arch-shaped trajectory, evoking the path of a rocket soaring into space. This intuitive and modern design captures the essence of progress and precision.
